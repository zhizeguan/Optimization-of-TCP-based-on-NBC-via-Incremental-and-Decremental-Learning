# Optimization-of-TCP-based-on-NBC-via-Incremental-and-Decremental-Learning
This repository contains all the materials concerning the master thesis: **Optimization of Transductive Conformal Predictors based on Naive Bayes Classifier via Incremental and Decremental Learning**.

# Code Structure
Please, refer to the notebook **Comparison between TCP and OTCPG based on MultinomialNB or GaussianNB.ipynb** and **Comparison among OTCP based on Different ML Methods.ipynb** in the folder **Code** for implementation details. The code in the notebook refers to some ideas from the paper **Exact Optimization of Conformal Predictors via Incremental and Decremental Learning** and uses the utility class **eli.py** directly. You can find the paper, code and utility class in the link: https://github.com/gchers/exact-cp-optimization.
